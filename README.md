# 🧠 RAG-based Assistant for Compliance Queries

## 📝 Problem Statement

Employees waste time searching through complex compliance documents, leading to delays and inconsistent answers. This project solves that by automating responses using a RAG-based assistant.

---

## ⚙️ Project Pipeline Overview

The project is divided into **four stages**:

---

### 1. Document Processing & Chunking

We prepare the input data by:

- Loading `.docx` files from a folder
- Merging all text content into a single `.parquet` file
- Splitting long texts into smaller overlapping chunks  
  - First by sentences, then by line breaks (`\n`) for fine-tuning  
  - Ensures that chunk size stays within the 512-token limit of the embedding model

📁 **Output:** Cleaned and chunked `.parquet` files saved in `data/chunks/`

---

### 2. Embedding Generation

📄 **Script:** `embeddings_and_database.py`

- A base class `GetEmbsNPYBase` handles chunking and text preparation
- A subclass `GetEmbsNPY_Gigachat` initializes the GigaChat embedder and builds embeddings
- Alternative subclasses can be added for Hugging Face or other models
- Each document’s chunks are saved:
  - `.npy` files in `data/embs/` (embedding vectors)
  - `.parquet` files in `data/chunks/` (original chunk texts)

💡 Chunks are stored per file to stay below Qdrant’s 32 MB upload limit.

---

### 3. Upload to Qdrant Vector Database

📄 **Script:** `embeddings_and_database.py`  
🐳 **Requirement:** Qdrant must be running locally via Docker

**Docker Setup:**
```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant
docker run -p 6333:6333 -v $(pwd):/qdrant/storage qdrant/qdrant


---

## 🚀 Features

- Sentence- and paragraph-aware chunking with overlap  
- GigaChat-based or Hugging Face embedding support  
- Docker-based Qdrant vector store with auto-creation of collections  
- Conversational Langchain-baised LLM integration with prompt engineering  
- Optional support for dialogue history  
- Modular, reusable components for embedding, retrieval, and query handling  

---

## ✅ Final Goal

A structured query-answering pipeline that returns:

- ✅ Final answer generated by an LLM  
- ✅ Relevant document chunks  
- ✅ Optional conversation history support
